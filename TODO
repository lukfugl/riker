arrows or something to indicate the length of a shift without filling in the
name on every day? Or maybe just the convention of a question mark at the next
slot that isn't covered...

layers

think about how to make shifts carry over from week to week, maintaining shift
history for the past, allowing editing of shifts in the future, without
excessive "caching" of shifts in the future, so that if you change the current
week shifts they can apply to the future, but don't necessarily do so (in case
this week just has an anomaly)

some kind of check in every minute or so and see if the page needs to be
reloaded would be cool. or even reload just the cells that need it. or, we
could just set an auto-refresh of the whole page every minute or so, but
where's the fun in that? Actually that's bad because it can refresh when
someone is entering something, and then what they entered is lost. (Happened to
me when filling in this week) Maybe do a refresh, or check whether a refresh is
needed, after an edit - or have a smart javascript refresh that waits to
refresh until done editing...
