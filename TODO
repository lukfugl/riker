Is test/ cruft?

Was it bad to nuke the rails makefile? In particular, how do we handle db
migrations?

generate a pdf or something that's able to print landscape by default. firefox
and ie apparently have zero support for the @page thing in css.

tweak the IPE styles - get rid of the funky fade out, use something other than
funky yellow, and after edit fade to the true bg not to white.

think about how to make shifts carry over from week to week, maintaining shift
history for the past, allowing editing of shifts in the future, without
excessive "caching" of shifts in the future, so that if you change the current
week shifts they can apply to the future, but don't necessarily do so (in case
this week just has an anomaly)
