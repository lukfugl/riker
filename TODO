layers

maybe have the td onclick initiate the proper ipe (in case they click on the
border, and then we could get rid of the min-height in that div css)

think about how to make shifts carry over from week to week, maintaining shift
history for the past, allowing editing of shifts in the future, without
excessive "caching" of shifts in the future, so that if you change the current
week shifts they can apply to the future, but don't necessarily do so (in case
this week just has an anomaly)
