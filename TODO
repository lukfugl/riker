Is test/ cruft?

maybe switch url scheme to /YYYY-MM-DD/HH and the like?

think about how to make shifts carry over from week to week, maintaining shift
history for the past, allowing editing of shifts in the future, without
excessive "caching" of shifts in the future, so that if you change the current
week shifts they can apply to the future, but don't necessarily do so (in case
this week just has an anomaly)
