Is test/ cruft?

  everything in it is generated stuff from the initial rails. but it would be
  nice to add tests...

Was it bad to nuke the rails makefile? In particular, how do we handle db
migrations?

  I'm fine with DDL "migrations"; this is what we do at work. individual update
  scripts, timestamped for order, with alter table calls, etc., in them. no
  nice rake task, but it's pretty easy to "psql blah < db/updates/foo-up" and
  "psql blah < db/updates/foo-down"

generate a pdf or something that's able to print landscape by default. firefox
and ie apparently have zero support for the @page thing in css.

think about how to make shifts carry over from week to week, maintaining shift
history for the past, allowing editing of shifts in the future, without
excessive "caching" of shifts in the future, so that if you change the current
week shifts they can apply to the future, but don't necessarily do so (in case
this week just has an anomaly)
