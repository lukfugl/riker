rails

model
    slots: week, day (of week), hour, layer, label

    week is either the date of a sunday or null. in the former case, this is a
    one-time signup. in the latter, it's a recurring signup. one-time signups
    override recurring signups. a one-time signup with a null label indicates a
    recurring signup is temporarily revoked (in all other cases, label must be
    non-null, non-empty). of course, week/day-of-week/hour is the primary key.
    when label would be null, the row is just omitted (except as noted above).

view
    primary
        week calendar for the current week
        color-coded shifts (maybe just use zebra striping of shifts)
        at least 2 layers - visitor layer (nurses, etc.) and shift layer. maybe another for things like church, nap, etc. - or maybe that's on the visitor layer.
        discreet layer dropdown, the current layer gets the ajax editing.
        riker mug in the corner, or keep riker to the about page?

controller
    ajax resources (colors and labels)
    (primary is all static html+ajax)
