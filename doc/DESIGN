    slots: date, hour, layer, label
    (ignoring recurring for now)

view
    primary
        week calendar for the current week
        color-coded shifts (maybe just use zebra striping of shifts)
        at least 2 layers - visitor layer (nurses, etc.) and shift layer. maybe another for things like church, nap, etc. - or maybe that's on the visitor layer.
        discreet layer dropdown, the current layer gets the ajax editing.
